## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONS & AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### 1. User Experience Gaps (Medium Priority)
* **Alert-based Notifications**: Uses `alert()` instead of proper toast/notification system
* **No Loading Skeletons**: Basic loading spinners instead of skeleton screens
* **Missing Image Management**: No proper image upload/optimization system
* **Limited Accessibility**: Could improve keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

### 2. Testing Infrastructure (Medium Priority)
* **No Test Suite**: Missing unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests
* **No Test Coverage**: No testing framework setup (Vitest, Cypress, Playwright)
* **Manual Testing Only**: Relies on manual testing which is not scalable

### 3. Payment System Incomplete (High Priority)
* **No Payment Gateway**: Checkout exists but no real payment processing
* **Missing Order Processing**: No actual order fulfillment workflow
* **No Payment Validation**: Basic form validation without payment verification

### 4. Production Readiness (Medium Priority)
* **Environment Management**: Limited environment configuration
* **Deployment Setup**: No CI/CD pipeline or deployment configuration
* **Error Logging**: No centralized error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
* **Performance Monitoring**: No analytics or performance monitoring setup

### 5. Limited Real-time Features (Low Priority)
* **No WebSocket Integration**: No real-time updates for inventory or orders
* **No Push Notifications**: Limited notification system
* **No Live Chat**: No customer support integration
