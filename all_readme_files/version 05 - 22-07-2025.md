- API Structure: âœ… All endpoints properly configured

### ðŸ‘¤ Test Accounts Created:
- Admin: admin@pharmacy.com / admin123
- Customer: customer@example.com / customer123

### ðŸ“š Database Setup Options:

- âœ… **Database Operations**: All CRUD operations working with real data
- âœ… **Authentication Flow**: Login/logout functionality fully implemented
- âœ… **API Integration**: Frontend stores successfully connected to database APIs
- âœ… **Development Workflow**: Hot reload, error handling, and debugging all functional

### ðŸ“Š Current Database Content:
```sql
