# Path Fix Instructions

## Issue
Nuxt/Vite has trouble with file paths containing spaces, which causes pre-transform warnings.

## Quick Solutions

### 1. Test Current Functionality
Despite warnings, the app may still work. Try:
- Visit http://localhost:3000
- Navigate to /login
- Test authentication functionality

### 2. Path-based Fix (Recommended)
Move project to a path without spaces:

```bash
# Create new location
mkdir C:\Projects\Pharmacy-Website

# Copy project files
xcopy "d:\Study\Project Folder\Self-Project on Github\Pharmacy Website\project" "C:\Projects\Pharmacy-Website\project" /E /I

# Navigate to new location
cd C:\Projects\Pharmacy-Website\project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Alternative: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
If available, run the project in WSL where path handling is more robust.

### 4. Environment Variable Workaround
Set NODE_OPTIONS to handle path issues:
```bash
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
npm run dev
```

## Authentication Fix Status
✅ SiteHeader.vue - Connected to auth store
✅ Auth store - Improved initialization
✅ Login flow - Proper state management
✅ Logout functionality - Complete cleanup

The authentication logic itself is now correct and should work once the path issues are resolved.
